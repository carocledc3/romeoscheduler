# `romeoscheduler`
Romeo's Grid-based Schedule Graphic maker. Made with [`typst`](https://github.com/typst/typst/). Built for the use of University of the Cordilleras undergraduate students, but applicable for any class schedule with fixed-length periods. Documentation WIP.

# Dependencies
- [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Installed [`typst`](https://github.com/typst/typst/) binary
  - The [Tinymist LSP](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist) will do in place of a `typst` binary for all text editors that support Tinymist.
- A text editor to edit YAML files with. I prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- (For subject `icon` feature) [Material Symbols](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/variablefont) font
- (Optional, for optimal usage) [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/), [Romeosevka](https://github.com/romeodisk/Romeosevka), or font with similar width

# Installation

    - **MacOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/typst/packages/local` 
    - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/typst/packages/local`
